# AI Collaborative Platform - Real Estate Analytics Architecture

## System Overview
The platform is designed as a real-time analytics solution for real estate and fintech applications, with a specific focus on property valuation and transaction monitoring in the UAE market.

### Core Architecture Principles
1. **Modularity**: Loose coupling between components
2. **Scalability**: Support for large datasets through chunked processing
3. **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different data sources and formats
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. **Usability**: Intuitive interface with real-time feedback
